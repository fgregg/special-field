\section*{Competition} 
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, American urban
sociologists grappled with the unprecedented size and rapid growth of
the industrial city. Their main explanation for these astonishing
social facts was that aggregations of people and organizations into
dense settlements and the locations of those settlements across the
land, were economically efficient. The distribution of people and
organizations among settlements tended to minimize the total costs of
transportation for the raw materials and finished goods of industrial
manufacturing. Within settlements, the central places should be
dominated by uses that most benefited from access the city or be
accessible by the city.

In these efficiency arguments, economic competition between firms was
the ultimate mechanism. Firms in places with cheap access to inputs
and markets survived and their less well placed competitors did
not. Populations followed jobs and settlements waxed or waned on the
fortunes of its firms competing in a national market.  In equilibrium,
the people are organizations are placed across and within settlements
in the manner that maximizes economic efficiency.

Contemporary critics attacked the competitive models on three
fronts. First, empirically, many districts of American cities were
used for purposes that were grossly economically inefficient. Second,
market competition for land is a historically contingent cultural
value. Some facts of American cities may be explained by market
efficiency, we need to attend to other values to adequately understand
urban forms. Third, we should not expect that distribution of people
and organizations in a growing city to be globally efficient. The form
of a growing city requires a theory of growth, not a theory of static
equilibrium. 

\subsection*{Distributions of Settlements and Economic Geography}
Sociologists have mainly left geographers to the task of explaining
the size and locations of settlements. The geographers' theories, or
at least the ones that we have attended to, have historically, focused
on two factors,: labor costs and transportation costs of raw material and
finished goods.\footnote{Firey 24}

The geographic distribution of raw materials, transportation network,
manufacturing technology, population, and labor prices combine to form
a geography of costs of operating a firm. Within this economic
geography, certain locations confer advantage to their resident firms
who win out against their poorly positioned
competitors. Advantaged locations would swell while the backwaters
dwindled.\footnote{ullman}

\subsubsection*{Population Ecology}
This economic geography model is a special case of the population
ecology model developed by x and y.  In economic geography, the
\emph{spatial distribution} of firms is the result of the competition
and selection of firms who have a \emph{locational} advantage over
competitors facing the same market. In the classic formulation of
population ecology, the \emph{distribution of poopulatoins} of
different types of firms is the result of competition and selection of
firm who have a \emph{strategic} advantage over competitors facing the
same market.\{cite here}. 

Both population ecology and the special case of economic geography are
models of how environments select firms that are somehow better fitted
to the environment. The models do not include the ability of firms to
meaningfully change their environment. This is a very useful
simplification and one that is certainly true for the small retail
businesses that X and Y used in as their empirical cases.  In economic
geography, this simplification may be less valid, as the geographic
concentration of firms is likely to effect the distribution of people,
the costs of labor, and even transportation and manufacturing
technique. We'll pick up this point again when in the section on
mutualistic interactions.

As such, these models should be used when
firms have little effect upon their environments. 

First, firms have little effect upon their environment. Within
economic geography, the locations of firms does not lead to a
significant redistribution of population or changing labor costs. For
population ecology, firms compete for share of a market but have no
real effect on total market size. In these models, environments cause
populations, populations do not cause environments.

Second, firms interact 



The simplifying assumptions of economic geography purposely omitted
many additional factors. We'll be most interested in two. First, firms,
even competing firms, can benefit from the presence of other firms,

it is a model of pure competition between firms within a regional or
national market, without any local interactions between
firms. Assuming equivalent locational factors, a firm is equally
affected if a competitor is down the street or in the next state. Even
less, could the firm benefit from

 been both used in both explicit theories of
urban forms and an often implicit mode of analysis. Explicit theories
first identify a spatial distribution of resources that were fixed or
slow-changing, and describe how people and organizations will
distribute themselves to optimizes access to those resources. In the
implicit mode, the analyst makes no special attempt to distinguish a
fixed, or slow changing environment from the relatively quickly
changing people or organizations of interest. Instead the analyst
makes a ceteris parebus assumption that the distribution of resources
are fixed and shows how actors seem to be respond to assumed fixed resources.
